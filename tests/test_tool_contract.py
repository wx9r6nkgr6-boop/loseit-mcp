"""The tool/protocol contract clients actually rely on.

An earlier version of this file asserted that a tool declaring an output schema
must not return text — supposedly the cause of a production outage. That was
wrong on the version we deploy: the framework wraps a scalar return as
``{"result": ...}`` and populates structured content to match. The outage was
Lose It's intermittent search fault, fixed by retrying reads.

What is worth pinning is behaviour on the wire: whether a declared schema is
actually satisfied when the tool is called. These assert that against real
``call_tool`` results rather than reading return annotations, which is what
made the previous version both wrong and unfalsifiable.
